# The-Hottest-Topics-in-Machine-Learning

It is at NIPS that some of the most ground-breaking work in the field of machine learning is presented. Using Python, the goal of this project is to discover the most recent trends in machine learning by analyzing a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade. Using pandas, sklearn, and re packages, as well as the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method, these techniques can be applied to a wide variety of text datasets.
